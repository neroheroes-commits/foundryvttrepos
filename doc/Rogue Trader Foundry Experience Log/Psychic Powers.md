Psychic powers are basically broken down into a number of different components. I'll list them here in what is approximately hierarchical order from top to bottom.

***Psychic Disciplines*** are the first thing a character needs to learn. A character may acquire at most three psychic disciplines, but in the core rules there are only three. If they added more in another book, I'm not sure.

The disciplines themselves provide high level information, sort of like a spell school in Pathfinder/D&D, except with more mechanics attached to them. Specifically, a discipline gives the following information:

1. ***The discipline name.*** This lets you know what the discipline is called.
2. ***The activation time.*** It appears that techniques within a discipline do not have individual casting times (like other games) and the casting time is instead dictated by the discipline itself. This applies to all techniques in the discipline.
3. ***A maintainable flag.*** This lets you know if techniques in the discipline can function for multiple actions at the psyker's option.
4. ***A range value.*** ~~How far the discipline's techniques can go.~~ It appears to be how far the Basic Technique can go, not all techniques.
5. ***A focus power test flag.*** ~~No idea what this is, but it exists.~~ After more looking around, I think this is a mix of information about *all* techniques in the discipline, but also the features of the discipline's Basic Technique. Why they did it this way, I'm not sure.

Psychic Techniques are the individual powers associated with a discipline. From a Pathfinder/D&D point of view, they are the spells (techniques) that belong to the spell schools (disciplines).
